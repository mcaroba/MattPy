GETTING STARTED

To get started using MattPy in a "quick and dirty" way, you can simply
download mattpy.py to a local directory on your machine, and from
a Python interactive session or within a Python script simply use the
execfile("/path/to/file/mattpy.py") command, where /path/to/file/ is
the directory where you downloaded mattpy.py. The recommended way to
install MattPy, however, is to install it as a Python module so that it
can be imported both interactively and from a script without the need
to keep track of the source file location. To do this, you can create a
directory where you store the mattpy.py file and add it to your Python
path. In a Linux shell this would be something along these lines:

************************************************************************
# Create modules directory under your home
mkdir ~/python_modules

# Download mattpy.py
wget https://github.com/mcaroba/MattPy/blob/master/mattpy.py ~/python_modules/.

# Add directory to your Python path
echo "export PYTHONPATH=\${PYTHONPATH}:~/python_modules" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
************************************************************************

If you don't use bash as your default shell then you'll need to change
to whatever the configuration file is in your case. Now you can import
MattPy as you would do with any other Python module:

************************************************************************
# Import with mattpy prefix, i.e. function() becomes mattpy.function()
import mattpy

# Import with custom prefix, e.g. function() becomes mp.function()
import mattpy as mp

# Import with mattpy original naming, i.e. function() stays function()
from mattpy import *
************************************************************************

DEPENDENCIES

MattPy relies on NumPy for all its functionalities and SciPy for some of
them. You need to install these packages if you have not already done
so.
