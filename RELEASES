MattPy v0.1 first release:

* Basic functionalities for piezoelectric and elastic tensors
  manipulation: rotations, transformation between different tensor
  (Voigt and Cartesian) and vector forms

* Projection scheme available with and without rotation optimization:
  all the projectors for all the point groups are available

* Documentation is lacking: only the description of the elasticity
  routines and one simple example is given

* Access to the functionalities is a bit rough at the moment, alias
  functions and a bit more automation for tensor recognition should
  be implemented
