MattPy v0.2

* Created the Tensor class for a more "pythonic" behavior of the
  package. Now the tensor if defined as an instance of this class,
  e.g., t = Tensor(). Rotations, projections, etc. are now available
  as methods of this class, e.g., t.rotate().

* Implemented the automatic detection of the tensor shape. The user
  can now use the Tensor class using lists of dimensions 3x3x3x3, 6x6,
  21, 3x3x3, 3x6 and 18. MattPy will automatically detect the shape
  of the tensor.

MattPy v0.1 first release:

* Basic functionalities for piezoelectric and elastic tensors
  manipulation: rotations, transformation between different tensor
  (Voigt and Cartesian) and vector forms

* Projection scheme available with and without rotation optimization:
  all the projectors for all the point groups are available

* Documentation is lacking: only the description of the elasticity
  routines and one simple example is given

* Access to the functionalities is a bit rough at the moment, alias
  functions and a bit more automation for tensor recognition should
  be implemented
